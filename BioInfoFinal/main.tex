\textbf{OBJECTIVE}: We want to demonstrate the skills learnt in this courses by performing a systematical bioinformatics analysis on teh gene MTF-1. We also aim to reproduce some of the analysis done by previous studies using the same data and similar techniques, and provide insight into this gene.\\
\textbf{RESULTS}: 1) equence of MTF-1 is conserved in different organisms. 2) MTF-1 may be an unstable hydrophilic protein. 3) MTF-1 has nuclear localization signal and zinc finger domains whichhelp it to bind metal response elements. 4) A consensus sequence named metal response elements can be foundin a certain set of genes. 5) Expression of a certain set of genes with metal response elements maybe regulated by MTF-1. \\
\textbf{CONCLUSION}: We successfully applied most of what we have learnt in this course to analyse the disease. The analysis indicates that platelet factor 4 in CD3+ cell is related to Aplastic Anemia, and the current immunosupressive treatment of this disease may not affect platelet factor 4 activity directly.
