\subsection{Introduction}
In this session, we discussed about the experiments that will be done next, with more details. 
The research route is illustrated below.

\subsection{Our \textit{Drosophila} models}
To study the potential impact of POPs on tumor migration, we used two well established models.

\subsubsection{$Eyeful$ model}
One of the two models is the $Eyeful$ flies\cite{ferres2006epigenetic}, which will be crossed with the \textit{w1118} flies. 
Since $Eyeful$  flies have distinct phenotype that indicates whether there is a tumor migration, 
it is a desirable model for this study. 
Moreover $Eyeful$ flies can be used to study the effect of POPs on different generations.


\subsubsection{$Ras^{v12/Ig}$ model}
The other model is the $Ras^{v12/Ig}$ model. Dissection is needed in 3rd pupa,
and with GFP, this model can produce more accurate information about the migration of tumor cells.
However, this model is used by crossing two stocks, and the larva can not survive the 3rd period.

\subsection{Results \& Discussion}

In this section, we talked with the tutor about the scheme of the experiments that will be done this term. In short, \textbf{preparation of model \textit{Drosophila} will be the first part of the experiments, and the most crucial part is the POPs treatment of the models}. With properly treated models, subsequential measurement could be done, for example, the qPCR, Western bolt or even HPLC/GC, etc.
